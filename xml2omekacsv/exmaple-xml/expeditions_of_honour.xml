  the first 1749.<br/>
  my birth day.<br/>
  one and forty.<br/>
  Does Hetty think of Me.<br/>
  Grant me O God a Happy Year.<br/>
  Clear and Warm.<br/>sat on A Rock by the sea side most part of the Day Alone.<br/>
  thank God for My Health and Grant me O God the Continuance of it.<br/>
  neither din’d nor sup’d on board.<br/>
  at Lutterels at Dinner.<br/>
  call’d at Cooks.<br/>
  Even the Governor not well.<br/>
  Hetty surely think of Me this Day—God bless Her and the little Girl.<br/>
  Tom is in a Crowd, He thinks not of me.<br/>
  God bless Him and poor Harry]]></story>
